# Final-year-PROJECT
**Weapon Detection and Tracking using YOLO**

**🚀 Project Overview**

This project focuses on detecting and tracking weapons using various versions of YOLO (You Only Look Once). Our goal is to compare the accuracy of different YOLO models and determine the best-performing one for final implementation.

**🔧 Tools & Technologies**

Model Training: Google Colab (A100 GPU)🔥
IDE: PyCharm Community Edition💻
Frameworks: PyTorch, OpenCV, Albumentations, Ultralytics
Dataset Format: YOLO format (.txt annotation files)
Dataset: Roboflow 📊

**📂 Dataset**

We have downloaded our dataset from Roboflow: https://universe.roboflow.com/elyspose/weapon-detect-elysium-data

**📌 Project Workflow**

1️⃣ Dataset Preparation 🗂️
- Download dataset from Roboflow.
- Perform image augmentation for better generalization.
  
2️⃣ Model Training 🎯
- Train the dataset using Google Colab (A100 GPU) for fast processing.
- Each member tests their respective YOLO version (YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv11).
  
3️⃣ Evaluation & Comparison 📊
- Compare the accuracy, precision, recall, and mAP (mean Average Precision) of each model.
- Select the best-performing YOLO model as our final model. ✅

  **📌 Final Selection Criteria**

Whichever YOLO model achieves the best accuracy and performance metrics will be considered as the final model for deployment.

**📊 Results & Performance**

- The detection accuracy of each YOLO version was evaluated.
- Real-time tracking performance was analyzed.
- Detailed results will be provided in the final report.

**💡 Future Enhancements**

Implement object tracking for continuous weapon monitoring.
Develop a web-based interface for better accessibility.
Improve model accuracy with additional training data.
